# CPASIM

This is a command line aimed to be a poor man's VHDL. I created this for my
students at SupInfo for a computer architecture class, so that they can build
their own logic gates and basic blocks.

Right now, it can compute forward circuits (ie, no loops) implemented in a
single module file. Look at the examples to see some of them. By default,
cpasim will draw the truth table of those circuits.
